backtrack algo: H2 is the worst, H1 and H3 are roughly equivalent
forward checking algo: H1, H2, and H3 are all better than in backtracking, but same order of efficiency applies H2 < H1 ~ H3

to compile: javac program.java
to run: java program lightupPuzzles.txt H1 (where H1, H2 and H3 are the heuristics)
